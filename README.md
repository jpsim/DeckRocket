# DeckRocket

## DeckRocket turns your iPhone into a remote for [Deckset](http://decksetapp.com) presentations

![](demo.gif)

## Requirements

DeckRocket is built in Swift and relies on Multipeer Connectivity on both OS X
and iOS. Xcode 6.3, OS X 10.10 and iOS 8 are all required to build, install and
use DeckRocket.

## Usage

1. Make sure you meet the requirements listed above.
2. Build and run both the "Mac" and "iOS" schemes in the `DeckRocket.xcodeproj`
   Xcode project. You should see a :rocket: icon in your menu bar.
3. Open a presentation in Deckset on your Mac.
4. Click the DeckRocket menu bar icon and select "Send Slides".

From there, swipe on your phone to control your Deckset slides, tap the screen
to toggle between current slide and notes view, and finally: keep an eye on the
color of the border!

Red means the connection was lost. Green means everything should work!

A connection should be established between the Mac and iOS apps within a few
seconds. You'll then be able to swipe through your slides and see Deckset
navigate to them fairly instantly.

The magic of Multipeer Connectivity should allow this to work even if devices
have no Internet connectivity and aren't even on the same WiFi network. But they
must both have either Bluetooth or WiFi turned on.

DeckRocket ðŸš€ now works on âŒš 

### Usage

It's pretty much the same as above except that you'll need to open the ï£¿á´¡á´€á´›á´„Êœ app and follow the Â«onscreen instructionsÂ».

Once the Â«Send SlidesÂ» operation finishes a watch slider will appear telling you the number of slides and the current slide you are on and you are free to move forward or backwards with the slider.
